# schnapps rules and scoring system

schnapps can be played in 2 and 3 players and the game slightly changes the rules, but the scoring and win condition stays the same.  

# terminology
points - total points across all rounds required to win the game.  
game points - points within the indiviual rounds required to win the round.  
tricks - [hard to explain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game)  
leading the trick - playing first.  
trump - suit that is decided to have more power over the other suits, takes any non trump trick.  
declarer (3 players) - declares the suit to be the trump.  

## scoring 
every player starts with 0 points, whenever they win they lose points, first to 10 wins.  
the way to win each round and gain points is by reaching 66 game points at any point in the game.  
you gain 3 points if your opponent(s) do not get any game points.  
you gain 2 points if your opponent(s) get less than 32 game points.
you gain 1 point if your opponent(s) get more than 32 game points.

## card values
cards have the same values all the time.  
they are:
    jack = 2 value  
    queen = 3 value  
    king = 4 value  
    10 card = 10 value  
    ace = 11 value  

## declarations
declarations exist for every suit, not just the trump. when leading the trick you can declare +20 by showing both the queen+king in the same suit and playing one of them. if the suit is the trump, you gain +40 instead of +20.  

# gameplay (2 players)
both players start each round with 5 cards. the last card in the deck is revealed and its suit becomes the trump. the game automatically picks a dealer (fictional) and the person who is not the dealer leads the first trick. in the next round the role of the dealer switches.  
the game has as many rounds as it takes for 1 person to win, there can only be 1 winner.  

### responding to a trick 
while the deck still has cards and is not closed, you may respond (play) any card of any suit. if the deck is out of cards or closed, you must respond to the suit, or play a trump should you not have any (or play any card if you have neither, though the game points still count). in order to take a trick, you must have played the highest value card/trump.  

### closing (all in)
the player leading the trick can choose to close the deck prematurely. this disallows drawing cards after the trick and forces the opponent to respond to the suit. if the closing player does not reach 66 game points in the end, he automatically loses.  
you are not allowed to close on the last two card (the card that is flipped to show the trump counts as a card).  

### exchanging
the player leading the trick can exchange the jack in trump (if he has one) for the revealed trump card on the end of the deck. you can not do this if the deck is closed.

# gameplay (3 players)
all players start with 6 cards, while the declarer (right of the dealer) recieves additional 2 cards. the declarer may only see the first 3 cards he is dealt, and must decide the trump based on them. if he can't decide, he can also flip a random card in the rest of hand and reveal it to everyone and that card's suit becomes the trump. the declarer then picks up the rest of his hand and discards 2 of the cards to have an equal amount. the declarer leads the first trick. the players who are not the declarer team up together and share game points.  

### responding to a trick
you must respond to the suit of the leading card in the trick, or play a trump if you have none (or play any card if you have neither, though the game points still count). the highest trump or the highest card in the same suit as the leading card wins the trick.
